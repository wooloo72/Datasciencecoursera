This is the list of variables in file generated by the run_analysis.R script

1 Activity  LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS
2 Subject   ranges from 1 to 30, id of a volunteer subject for activity measurement

column 3 to 81 contains the average of the following feature measurement

These features covers the mean and standard deviation on time and frequency measurment of 
- the body and gravity acceleration from an accelerometer and all 3 dimentions axis X,Y,Z
- the body acceleration form the gyroscope on all 3 dimentions axis X,Y,Z
- Jerk signals derived from the body linear acceleration and angular velocity
- the Magnitude of the 3 dimentional signals
- the mean frequency (for frequency measurments only)
